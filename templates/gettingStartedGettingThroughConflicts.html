            <p>
              Merge conflicts occur when someone pushes changes to master after another person has pushed changes to that same file to
              master. More specifically, if Person A and Person B start working on the same file and Person A pushes changes
              to that file, but Person B pushes changes to the same file without rebasing their branch to pick up the changes
              from Person A’s commit, then you may have a merge conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
              The screenshots below show the local computer, which does not have the most recent changes from master. In this example,
              Person B has done the git commands mentioned in the previous section (status, add, commit). They made a commit
              annotated as “this commit will error when pushed - as the head is one commit further than this local”.

              When the user runs
              the following command, they encounter an error because of a merge conflict:
