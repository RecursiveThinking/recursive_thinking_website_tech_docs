                            Merge conflicts occur when someone pushes changes to master after another person has pushed changes to that same file to master. More specifically, if Person A and Person B start working on the same file and Person A pushes changes to that file, but Person B pushes changes to the same file without rebasing their branch to pick up the changes from Person A’s commit, then you may have a merge conflict. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The screenshots below show the local computer, which does not have the most recent changes from master. In this example, Person B has done the git commands mentioned in the previous section (status, add, commit). They made a commit annotated as “this commit will error when pushed - as the head is the one commit farther than this local”.
