                            Now that you are all set up, you can learn how to do work on the site.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Committing Changes</h5>
                        <p>
                            If you have done some work on the website and you want to push your changes to the repository, perform the following commands.
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Re-initialize a Git repository in your project folder by running a <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git init</span>command in your terminal.
                            </li>
                            <ol class="alpha-list">
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        When you run this command, you should get a “Re-initializing git repository in this location” message. If you do not get this message, or get a message that says “Initializing git repository in this location,” stop, as something went wrong in the cloning process. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <li>
                                Add untracked files. 
                            </li>
                            <ol class="alpha-list">
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        If you have created new files or made changes to existing ones, you will need to add your changes.
                                    </p>
                                    <ol class="roman-list">
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                First, run the command git status to make sure that you are on the master branch, which reflects the production-ready state. This will also allow you to see what files have not yet been added, as they will appear in red. Added files will appear in green. 
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <img src="public/images/contributing/committing1.jpg" alt="The untracked files are displayed in red.">
                                        <p class="img-caption">
                                            The untracked files are displayed in red.
                                        </p>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                    To add files, run the <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git add <filename></span> command.
                                                            For example, if you created or edited a file named “readMe1,” you would add the file by running a <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git add readME1.md</span>command.
                                            </p>
                                            <img src="public/images/contributing/committing2.jpg" alt="Add each file (readMe1, readMe2 and readMe3).">

                                                Add each file (readMe1, readMe2 and readMe3).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Once added, they will appear green when you run the <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git status</span>command. 
                                            </p>

                                            </p>

                                    <p>
                                        When you are ready to commit your changes, you can run the commit command, which includes a mandatory message detailing what action you have taken. Do this by running
                                        <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git commit -m “”</span>in your terminal. (Inside of the quotation marks, you will type your message details.)    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, once you are ready to commit readMe1.md, you would run <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git commit -m “now I have pushed the files where we have resolved conflicts”</span>in your terminal, or whatever message you choose.
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="public/images/contributing/committing4.jpg" alt="The files have been committed and include a message detailing the action taken.">

                                        To make the final step in pushing your changes to Git, where they will show up in your commit history and in the project directory on GitHub, run the<span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git push origin master</span>command in your terminal.
                                    </p>
