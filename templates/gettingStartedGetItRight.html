                        <p>
                            Now that you are all set up, you can learn how to do work on the site.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Committing Changes</h5>
                        <p>
                            If you have done some work on the website and you want to push your changes to the repository, perform the following commands.
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Re-initialize a Git repository in your project folder by running a <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git init</span>command in your terminal.
                            </li>
                            <ol class="alpha-list">
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        When you run this command, you should get a “Re-initializing git repository in this location” message. If you do not get this message, or get a message that says “Initializing git repository in this location,” stop, as something went wrong in the cloning process. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <li>
                                Add untracked files. 
                            </li>
                            <ol class="alpha-list">
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        If you have created new files or made changes to existing ones, you will need to add your changes.
                                    </p>
                                    <ol class="roman-list">
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                First, run the command git status to make sure that you are on the master branch, which reflects the production-ready state. This will also allow you to see what files have not yet been added, as they will appear in red. Added files will appear in green. 
                                            </p>
                                        </li>

                                        <p class="img-caption">
                                                The untracked files are displayed in red.
                                        </p>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                    To add files, run the <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git add <filename></span> command.
                                                            For example, if you created or edited a file named “readMe1,” you would add the file by running a <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git add readME1.md</span>command.
                                            </p>
                                            <img src="public/images/contributing/committing2.jpg" alt="untracked-add">
                                            <p class="img-caption">
                                                Add each file (readMe1, readMe2 and readMe3).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Once added, they will appear green when you run the git status command. 
                                            </p>
                                            <img src="public/images/contributing/committing3.jpg" alt="untracked-added">
                                            <p class="img-caption">
                                                Now that the files have been added, they will appear in green when you check their status.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        When you are ready to commit your changes, you can run the commit command, which includes a mandatory message detailing what action you have taken. Do this by running
                                        <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git commit -m “”</span>in your terminal. (Inside of the quotation marks, you will type your message details.)    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, once you are ready to commit readMe1.md, you would run <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git commit -m “now I have pushed the files where we have resolved conflicts”</span>in your terminal, or whatever message you choose.
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="public/images/contributing/committing4.jpg" alt="untracked-message">

                                    Push up your changes.

                                        To make the final step in pushing your changes to Git, where they will show up in your commit history and in the project directory on GitHub, run the<span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">git push origin master</span>command in your terminal.
                                    </p>

                                        If successful, when future collaborators pull the repository, your changes will have been included.
