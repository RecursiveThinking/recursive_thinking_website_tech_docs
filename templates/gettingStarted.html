                            Before you begin, you will need to have a few tools to work on the site. Make sure you have the ones listed in the section below.
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                                <p>Learn how we stay in communication and where we do our work. We will cover steps to get connected to the RT Slack channel, the Zeplin page for website mockups and the GitHub page. Slack is the best way to stay in contact. Zeplin shows the RT website mockups. The GitHub page allows you to get the code and start contributing once you have the prerequisites.
