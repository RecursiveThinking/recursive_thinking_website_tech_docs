                            Before you begin, you will need to have a few tools to work on the site. Make sure you have the ones listed in the section below.
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                                <a href="#gettingStartedGetConnected">Get Connected</a>
                                <p>Learn how we stay in communication and where we do our work. We will cover steps to get connected to the RT Slack channel, the Zeplin page for website mockups and the GitHub page. Slack is the best way to stay in contact. Zeplin shows the RT website mockups. The GitHub page allows you to get the code and start contributing once you have the prerequisites.

                                    If multiple people are working on the same file, you may encounter situations where the master branch has different changes than what you have locally. When this occurs, you are going to need to resolve these conflicts. Read more for a merge conflict tutorial.
