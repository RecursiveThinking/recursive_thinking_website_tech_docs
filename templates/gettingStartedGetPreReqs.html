                        <h5>Integrated Development Environment (IDE):</h5>
                        <p>
                            An IDE is where you write and edit code. If you are just getting started, it is recommended to pick one to learn on, since you can switch to a different IDE at any time. VSCode is a great one to start with. Note that the following tutorials are specific to VSCode, but if you are more comfortable with another IDE, please use that one. Depending on your preference, you can download one of these IDE options.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <h6>Download Visual Studio Code at </h6>
                            <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="/">https://code.visualstudio.com</a></li>

                            <h6>Download WebStorm at </h6>
                            <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="/">https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Download Node.js</h5>
                        <p> 
                            Select the version for your OS at <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="/"><span class="linkFormatting">https://nodejs.org/en</span></a>. Node.js is needed to install helper modules (libraries) for JavaScript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can check if Node and npm (bundled with Node) are installed by opening your terminal/command line and typing <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">node -v</span> or <span class="codeSnippetGitCommand">npm -v</span> (this is called running a command) and then hitting the “enter” key. It will return a version number (for Node or npm) below if correctly installed, such as v8.11.3 (or whatever the recommended version is at your time of install).
                        </p>
                        <h5>Download Git</h5>
                        <p> 
                            Select the version for your OS at <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="/"><span class="linkFormatting">https://git-scm.com/downloads</span></a>. Git is a version control system to help track changes made to code. Git makes it possible for multiple people to work on the RT site, even at the same time.
                        </p>

                            *Windows Users: Note that Mac (OSX) has a built-in terminal that supports Bash. Windows does not. When you install Git on Windows, it should, by default, install <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17807485/what-is-the-exact-meaning-of-git-bash"><span class="linkFormatting">Git Bash</span></a>, which is the terminal most often used to run git commands. Windows users can check for a Git Bash installation simply by searching for it in their start bar or Windows Explorer. However, in the next year, people with a current copy of Windows 10 could see native support for Git Bash.
