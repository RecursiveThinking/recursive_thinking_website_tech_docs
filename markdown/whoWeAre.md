<p>
    Recursive Thinking (RT) is a collective of people dedicated to career development in the technology space. In order to learn from others, members needed a website to showcase their skillsets to establish connections in and out of RT meetings. As a way to build skills, developers, designers and technical writers work on the website together. By participating, you will provide RT collaborators with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>-A schedule of upcoming meetings</li>
    <li>-A place to provide lesson requests and vote for lessons</li>
    <li>-Documentation of interview questions and answers</li>
    <li>-A professional profile</li>
</ul>
