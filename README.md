# Recursive Thinking Website - Tech Docs

This Repository holds a simple website which describes how to get started contributing to the Recursive Website Project.
    
To Start, simply download (or git clone - if this process is comfortable for you) this repository to your computer, and open layout.html inside a local development server.
    
## To Clone the Project From Github:
    
![GitHub Clone](_md/img/01_download_or_clone_from_github.jpg)

    The following terminal command requires a basic knowledge of how to use a terminal/CLI (Command Line Interface).  Additionally, the git command requires the installation of Git (Link) on your system.
    
    If you have the above covered, Great!  Then go to the recursive_thinking_website_tech_docs page and click on the clipboard/arrow button on the right side of the address link.
    
    Then, go to your terminal, and execute the following command:
    
    git clone <paste your address here>

## To Startup the Site - Download an Extension Like Live Server:

    Note:  This is strictly (from what I know) a VSCode Extension.  If you are using a different IDE, you'll have to find a solution for that.  Good Luck!
